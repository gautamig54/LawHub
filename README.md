# LawHub
This website is basically for the common people who are unaware of the proceedings of the court and how to go about a particular case. It will provide information about a case, e.g. what sections are enforced, what judgements have been passed, challenges faced and many more. Many people are tricked by the corrupt lawyers or police due to their lack of knowledge, hence, having a brief knowledge about their case will help them get justice on valid basis. 
 #### Features 
  1. Search for the most relevant case to that of yours. Dropdown for the categories and then sub categories.
  2. Read the cases relevant to yours. It contains the case details, which sections are involved and how one went about it, all the proceedings. 
  3. It contains the steps to follow/ guide for what to do next in such cases.
  4. One can upload the case details by signing up. Also, while uploading one has to specify the domains. Pictures can also be uploaded.
  5. One can upvote/downvote a case and its judgement and leave comments.
Since, this project is in the very early stage of development, therefore suggestions regarding better features are open.
